## 🥵 Problem Statement

Building custom AI and Gen AI systems can be challenging due to the need for flexibility, scalability, and production-readiness. Developers often face problems like:

- **Complexity**: Creating AI systems from scratch is complex, especially when combining different technologies for model management, data processing, and integration.
  
- **Scalability**: Ensuring that AI systems can handle large-scale data and provide efficient, real-time responses.
  
- **Integration**: Standardizing and fluid data communication between the different core components of an AI System, especially when deployed on different servers.
  
- **Maintenance & Updates**: The AI landscape evolves rapidly, and maintaining systems with the latest models and technologies is challenging, stressful and costly.

`rakam_systems` addresses these challenges by offering a flexible, lean framework that helps developers build AI systems efficiently, while minimizing code maintenance overhead and focusing on ease of deployment.

## ✨ Key Features

- **Modular Framework**: `rakam_systems` is a framework for building AI and Gen AI systems, with **Components** serving as the core building blocks.
  
- **Customizability**: Designed to provide robust tools for developing custom Gen AI solutions. Many classes are abstract, offering flexibility while keeping the codebase streamlined by limiting predefined functionality to common use cases.
  
- **Production-Ready**: Built for scalability and ease of deployment:
  - Libraries are chosen for their efficiency and scalability.
  - Components exchange data in a structured way, facilitating API integration.
  - Includes Docker/Django API templates for easy deployment: [Service Template](https://github.com/Rakam-AI/rakam-systems-service-template).
    
- **Lean Design**: Focused on minimizing breaking changes and ensuring code fluidity.
  
- **Best-in-Class Supporting Tools & Approaches**: We select the best libraries and technical approaches for each specific task to keep the codebase lean and manageable, addressing the challenge of evolving technologies. We welcome contributions to improve these approaches and are open to new ideas.
  

- **Engine Update**: We also deploy regular **Engine Updates** to ensure that the library stays current with the latest advancements in AI, minimizing maintenance challenges.
